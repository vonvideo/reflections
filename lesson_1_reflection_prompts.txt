How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helped me focus only on the lineas that were changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    save time looking for newly introduced errors, be able to restore older functionality.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: versions that make logical sense, new feature, bug fix...
    Cons: may choose the wrong time to do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They are code oriented.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see all the commits, diff to see difference to previous versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    knowing I could revert to previous versions when it worked.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for whatever is intented to do :-)
