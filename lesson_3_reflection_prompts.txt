When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
work on different computers, have more contributors

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
No need to pull insignifficant changes, maybe you are not ready to receive changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
a branch is in a repository; a clone duplicates a repository; a fork is a clone on github that mentions the repository author...

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
See change log offline, know if additional changes were made remotely since last pull

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Maybe easier in an environment/phisical location where all the developers can communicate directly and the project is structured so that developers work on theit own separate files.
More difficult when the opposite scenatio is true.
